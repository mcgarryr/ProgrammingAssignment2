## These functions are used to cache and compute the inverse of a matrix

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special matrix object that is able to 
## cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The cacheSolve function computes the inverse of the special matrix calculated
## by the makeCacheMatricx function. If the inverse has already been calculated,
## and the matrix hasn't changed, cacheSolve retrieves the inverse.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
